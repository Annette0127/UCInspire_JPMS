## Two Folders

### Building_Ground_Truth

This folder mainly contains the code I used to generate the "ground truth" architecture according to the module descripters.



### Part_of_ARCADE

The code in this folder mainly comes from [ARCADE](https://bitbucket.org/joshuaga/arcade/src/master/), and it could run on Java9+ projects.
